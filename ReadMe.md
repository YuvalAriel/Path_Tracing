> A basic python implementation of a path tracer - "Path tracing is a computer graphics Monte Carlo method of rendering images of three-dimensional scenes such that the global illumination is faithful to reality." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing)

### Motivation 

Inspired by Matt Godbolt's [presentation](https://youtu.be/HG6c4Kwbv4I) at CppCon 2019, i chose this project as a way to further immerse and improve my Python programming skills.

### Path traced images

Here are some rendered images i rendered demonstrating the current capabilities of this Path Tracer such as shadow effects from multiple light sources and reflectance:
